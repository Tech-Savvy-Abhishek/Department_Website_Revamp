#### `Web Design`, `UI/UX`, `Adobe Illustrator`

This project focuses on revamping the user interface and experience (UI/UX) of the NITK Department's website.
The goal is to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing website with improved navigation and functionality.


This website redesign project was completed as part of the GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) Technical Club's recruitment process.
It served as a practical assessment to evaluate my skills and capabilities in the field of web design and UI/UX. 
The project demonstrates my commitment to enhancing the user interface and experience of the NITK Department's website, which aligns with the goals and values of GDSC.
